    "Grid search CV (Cross-Validation) is a hyperparameter tuning technique used in machine learning to find the optimal combination of hyperparameters for a given model. The purpose of grid search CV is to exhaustively search through a specified hyperparameter space and evaluate the model's performance for each combination of hyperparameters using cross-validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In grid search CV, we first define a grid of hyperparameters that we want to search through. For example, if we are using a support vector machine (SVM) model, we may want to search through different values of the regularization parameter C and the kernel function type (linear, polynomial, or radial basis function). We can define a grid of hyperparameters as a dictionary where each key corresponds to a hyperparameter name and its value is a list of possible values for that hyperparameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we use cross-validation to evaluate the performance of the model for each combination of hyperparameters in the grid. Cross-validation involves splitting the dataset into k-folds, where k is typically 5 or 10. We then train the model on k-1 folds and evaluate its performance on the remaining fold. We repeat this process k times, each time using a different fold as the validation set. This allows us to get a more accurate estimate of the model's performance on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For each combination of hyperparameters in the grid, we perform cross-validation and calculate an average score (e.g., accuracy, F1 score, etc.) across all folds. We then select the combination of hyperparameters that gives us the best score as our final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid search CV can be computationally expensive, especially if we have a large number of hyperparameters and a large dataset. However, it is a powerful technique that can help us find the optimal combination of hyperparameters for our model and improve its performance on unseen data."

    "Grid search CV and randomized search CV are two popular hyperparameter tuning techniques used in machine learning. The main difference between them is how they search through the hyperparameter space.\n",
    "\n",

    "Grid search CV exhaustively searches through a predefined grid of hyperparameters, evaluating the model's performance for each combination of hyperparameters using cross-validation. Grid search is a simple and systematic approach that guarantees that all possible combinations of hyperparameters in the grid are evaluated. However, it can be computationally expensive, especially if the hyperparameter space is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Randomized search CV, on the other hand, randomly samples hyperparameters from a predefined distribution and evaluates the model's performance for each combination using cross-validation. Randomized search is less systematic than grid search, but it can be more efficient when the hyperparameter space is large, as it does not evaluate all possible combinations of hyperparameters. Instead, it focuses on exploring the most promising regions of the hyperparameter space.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When to choose one over the other depends on the size of the hyperparameter space and the computational resources available. If the hyperparameter space is small and computationally feasible to evaluate all possible combinations, then grid search CV may be a good option. However, if the hyperparameter space is large and computationally expensive to evaluate all possible combinations, then randomized search CV may be a better option as it can explore a larger portion of the hyperparameter space in less time.\n",
